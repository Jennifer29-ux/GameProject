This is a Space Game I created using C++  Language in my university under the supervision of my [Professor Glory Lee]()

This lost in Space Game randomly creates power-ups for the player with a help of a direction map.Designed to check if the player has a hit power up and when removed it has an effect on the player.There is also a map to show the power-ups and the poisiton of the player. The scores of the player is calculated automatically and the game ends when the player hits the bomb.
