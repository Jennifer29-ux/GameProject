This is a Space Game I created using C++  Language in my university under the supervision of my Professor Glory Lee

This lost in Space Game randomly creates power-ups for the player with a help of a direction map.Designed to check if the player has a hit power up and when removed it has an effect on the player.
 The scores of the player is calculated automatically and the game ends when the player hits the bomb.
